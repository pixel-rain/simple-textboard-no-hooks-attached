Work in progress. A simple anonymous textboard, it is mostly a study project to test React without hooks, React Router, reCAPTCHA etc, the back-end was originally written by me for a FreeCodeCamp project and currently isn't modified and isn't integrated with the front-end yet.

The front-end part was created with Create React App, so it follows the usual commands - 'npm start' to run the front-end in the development mode, 'npm test' to run tests, 'npm run build' to build it for production and 'npm run eject' to eject from the build tool and configuration choices.

To run the both front-end and back-end in the dev mode use the following command: 'concurrently "npm run server" "npm start"' (you should have concurrently npm package being installed).
